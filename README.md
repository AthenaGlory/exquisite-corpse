================

A programming game where each person contributes a new function that MUST use the previous function in some way.

## Rules:
1. Function must validate and be linted using at least default options
2. Function must use the previous commits function in some way (combinatory)
3. Check your code works before committing it!
4. It should have some kind of representation that is viewable, but it doesn't have to use the DOM, feel free to get creative 
5. Please follow the format
6. 'nextUp' is an example function. You can just replace it with your own, call it last inside init(), and remember to include the previous function inside of your own
7. jQuery is supplied for normalization, but let's try and not use other libraries, unless it's really really really (really) cool.
